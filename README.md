## ✨ What is new in v0.3.0

### 🎨 User interface

- Completely redesigned the Web UI with a neon, retro, Windows-friendly appearance.
- Renamed the interface to **SIMORGH SCANNER**.
- Added a soft neon flicker effect to the application title.
- Added a persistent header containing:
  - `FA / EN` language selector
  - animated radar
  - current application status
- Improved responsive behavior for different resolutions and window sizes.
- Removed unnecessary visual framing around the radar.

### 📑 Page structure

The Web UI is divided into four independent pages:

- 🔍 **Scanner**
- 📊 **Results**
- 📁 **Files**
- 🧾 **Log**

Additional behavior:

- **Scanner** is the default landing page.
- Starting a scan automatically opens **Results**.
- **Live Work Log** is displayed on its own page.
- A persistent bottom navigation bar is available between pages.
- A scroll-to-top button is placed in the bottom-right corner.

### 🔍 Scanner controls

The Scanner page includes:

- ▶️ Start Scan
- ⏹️ Stop
- ⏯️ Continue
- 🧹 Clear
- ❌ Cancel

Other Scanner changes:

- The default ISP category is **International**.
- The animated radar is located in the main header.
- Custom `.txt` ISP lists can be imported into the scanner.
- Manual targets and built-in ISP lists remain supported.

### 📊 Results

- Scan results are displayed as independent neon cards.
- Each scanned IP has its own result card.
- Result cards show:
  - ⚡ Latency
  - 📈 Average Latency
  - ✅ Pass
  - 🚀 Speed
- Added hover and selection animations for result cards.
- Added a neon indicator beside the results title.
- Moved `SORT BY` into its own control bubble.
- Results can be sorted by:
  - Latency
  - Average Latency
  - Pass
  - Speed

### 📶 Scan progress

The old progress bar was replaced with three independent progress cards:

- 🔵 `SCAN`
- 🟣 `RE-CHECK`
- 🟪 `SPEED`

Each card displays:

- progress percentage
- completed target count
- remaining target count
- current stage status

The summary also shows:

- ✅ Clean
- ❌ Fail
- 🔄 Re-check
- 🚀 Speed

### 📌 Floating controls

- The scanner control bubble normally stays above `SORT BY`.
- It becomes floating when its original position leaves the visible area.
- It returns automatically when scrolling upward.
- Enter and exit animations are smooth and immediate.
- Button hover effects remain active while floating.

### 🌐 Local server

The Web UI uses one fixed local address:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:21301
```

Configuration:

```text
Local IP: 127.0.0.1
Port:     21301
Version:  v0.3.0
```

The local server is bound to the loopback interface and is not intended to be exposed directly to the public network.

## 🪟 Windows Standalone edition

The Windows Standalone edition is the easiest way to run SIMORGH SCANNER.

1. Download the Windows Standalone x64 executable.
2. Double-click the `.exe` file.
3. The embedded runtime is extracted locally.
4. The Web UI opens at `http://127.0.0.1:21301`.

### Standalone characteristics

- No Python installation is required.
- No `pip install` command is required.
- No initial internet connection is required to unpack or start the application.
- Python runtime, Python dependencies, scanner files, Xray files, and Web UI assets are bundled.
- Internet access is required only when the user actually scans or tests IPs.
- Application data is extracted under the current Windows user profile.

Because the executable is not necessarily code-signed with a public certificate, Windows SmartScreen may display a warning on first launch.
